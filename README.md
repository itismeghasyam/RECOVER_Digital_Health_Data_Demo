This repository provides **sample code** to access and work with data from the [**RECOVER - Digital Health Data**](https://platform.sb.biodatacatalyst.nhlbi.nih.gov/u/recover/recover-digital-health-data) project on the **Seven Bridges** platform.

## Read: Accessing Data in Seven Bridges

This section demonstrates how to **read** data from the Seven Bridges environment, including methods to access data:

#### a. [Per Participant](read/access_dataset.R)
- Fetch data related to a single participant.
- Useful for case-level analysis or validation.

#### b. [Group/List of Participants](read/access_dataset_cohort.R)
- Access data for multiple participants in bulk.
- Supports operations over cohorts or subgroups.

#### c. [Filtering, Summarizing, and Data Modifications](read/access_dataset_adv.R)
- Apply filters to extract subsets of data.
- Perform summarization tasks.

---

## Write: Exporting Results

This section shows how to [**write/save results**](write/write_data.R) (e.g., from Data Studio) back to a designated location within the same Seven Bridges project.

---

## Analysis: Some analysis templates

This section has template for **analysis**: summarizing metrics

#### a. [SD, Mean, Median etc.,](analysis/analysis_summary_metrics.R)
- Compute summary metrics for selected vars, per participant

#### b. [sample data](analysis/load_example_data.R)
- Load example data for analysis template

---

## Data Dictionaries

This section has data dictionaries for each of the datasets. A data dictionary has two
columns, "FIELD" and "DESCRIPTION", FIELD(columns) available in the dataset and their DESCRIPTIONS

## NOTE: Sleep Analysis

#### a. Sleep Regularity Index (SRI)
To read more about how to compute Sleep Regularity Index (SRI), please refer to these two files: [function CODE](https://github.com/itismeghasyam/recover-sleep-measures/blob/main/scripts/functions/sri.R) and [execution CODE](https://github.com/itismeghasyam/recover-sleep-measures/blob/main/scripts/sri.R)

#### b. Sleep SD Measures
To read more about how to compute Sleep SD Measures, please refer to this script: [sleepSD.R](https://github.com/itismeghasyam/recover-sleep-measures/blob/main/scripts/sleepSD.R)


## Requirements

- Access to the **Seven Bridges platform** with appropriate project permissions.
- Access to RECOVER project on **Synapse platform**.
